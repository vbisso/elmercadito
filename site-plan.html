          <li>Yellow Pepper – Aji Amarillo</li>
          <p>Aji amarillo is a fundamental ingredient in Peruvian gastronomy, since you can prepare classic recipes such as “ají de gallina”, “huancaína cream”, “causa de pulpa de cangrejo”, “cau-cau” and much more. In addition, its consumption helps in burning calories and abdominal fat. Contains capsaicin that improves blood circulation and reduces cholesterol levels. It is recommended to keep this grocery refrigerated for its good conservation. </p>
          <li>Red Pepper – Rocoto</li>
          <p>Ideal to accompany everything from soups to main courses to give it that extra spicy taste that you want so much. Its consistency is thicker, since it is an ideal dip for tequeños, appetizers, nachos and more. Contains capsaicin, which helps improve blood circulation in the body. In addition, it stimulates the nervous system to produce endorphins that cause a feeling of satisfaction and relaxation.</p>
